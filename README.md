###### Hey friends, today in this blog you’ll learn how to Build URL Shortener using PHP with MySQL & jаvascript.

A URL shortener is a service that helps take longer URLs (which can be more than a hundred characters) and transform/convert them into manageable or short links that rarely pass 20 characters. In this project [URL Shortener Website], there is only an input field on the website to enter or paste a long URL and a button to shorten the long URL. This input field has full validation that means the user can only type or enter a URL to shorten it.

When the user types a valid long URL and clicks on the shorten button then there is appears a popup box with a short url/link and a save button to edit or save the short URL. Users can only change or edit the short URL at that time, later it can’t be changed. Once the user clicks on the save button then the page will reload and there is shown the user’s created short URL, long URL, clicks, and a delete button to delete the particular row or link from the URLs area section.
